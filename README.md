# Mondrian-project-CSS-

This CSS project creates a representation of a Mondrian-style artwork using HTML and CSS. Mondrian was a Dutch artist known for his abstract compositions using primary colors and straight lines.

The HTML structure consists of a container div with nine inner divs representing different colored blocks. Each div has a specific class corresponding to its color (red, blue, yellow, black, or white). The CSS styles define the grid layout for the container and specify the background colors for each class.

The container div is styled as a grid with specific dimensions, and each inner div is positioned within this grid using grid-column and grid-row properties. The colors are chosen to mimic Mondrian's characteristic palette, with bold primary colors and neutral tones.

Overall, this project showcases how CSS grid layout can be used to create visually appealing geometric compositions reminiscent of Mondrian's iconic artworks.
